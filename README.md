We start with the problem that, for laptop users, it is inconvenient to carry a mouse around. For presenters, there is not always clicker available when needed and it is expensive to buy one. For programmers and writers, we want to free their hands from constantly moving from keyboard to the mouse. We come up with an idea to solve the problem using mobile device, since smart phone has becoming one item that most people are used to carry around everyday. Therefore, a windows phone application is made, integrated with the solutions in a single piece of software.The implementation of the project last for three months throughout the 2012 fall mobile computing course offered in University of Wisconsin.
